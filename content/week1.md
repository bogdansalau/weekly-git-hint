If you aren't capable of typing git properly (just like me), you may want to define some aliases in your bash profile (~/.bash_profile), e.g.
```
alias gut="git"
alias gti="git"
alias gitgit="git"
```

You might also define some more aliases that free you from having to write git at all:
```
alias push="git push"
```
